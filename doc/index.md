## YepError
Provide base class for all errors generated by Yep Apps.

All `YepError`s should contain the following
- `title` - The display name of the error class
- `name` - Display name plus the error code. Used by uncaught error handling.
- `message` - Same as regular old Error.
- `details` - Very Useful! Provide more information about the origin of the error, and more details about what went wrong specifically.
  - For example, when throwing an SSO Error, this might useful: ```{ details: type: "sso", ssoParts: { id, email, bearerToken }```
- `code` - The enum value for the type of error. All errors should support unknown value.
- static `Errors` enum - with each type of error created.
- Support for `toString` to `Error XXX`.
- `isCritical` - Flags the error as critical depending on the codes that you set in your `_criticalCodes`.
    - For example:
    ```javascript
        class CustomError extends YepError {
                get title() { return "CustomError"; }
                get _criticalCodes() { return [Errors["DOH"], Errors["BAZ"]]; }
    ```

When extending YepError you must provide the following
- static `groupCode` property that is unique.
- static `Errors` enum for your custom error types.
- static `isMyCustomError` method.
- override the title property.
- If you have critical codes, override the `_criticalCodes` property.
