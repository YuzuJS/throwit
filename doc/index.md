## YepError
Provide base class for all errors generated by Yep Apps.

All `YepError`s should contain the following
- `title` - The display name of the error class
- `name` - Display name plus the error code. Used by uncaught error handling.
- `message` - Same as regular old Error.
- `code` - The enum value for the type of error. All errors should support unknown value.
- static `Errors` enum - with each type of error created.
- Support for `toString` to `Error XXX`.

When extending YepError you must provide the following
- static `groupCode` property that is unique.
- static `Errors` enum for your custom error types.
- static `isMyCustomError` method.
- override the title property.
